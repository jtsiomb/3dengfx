			The website of this library is located at:
			<a href="http://thelab.demoscene.gr/nuclear/3dengfx/">http://thelab.demoscene.gr/nuclear/3dengfx/</a><br>
			There you can always find the latest release of the library, plus news,
			screenshots, etc.<br>
			<br>
			The current development version can be obtained from my subversion repository by
			anonymous svn here:
			<a href="svn://nuclead.dnsalias.com/pub/3dengfx">svn://nuclead.dnsalias.com/pub/3dengfx</a><br>
			Note that this runs from my own machine, and although it is on a DSL line and
			should be accessible most of the time, it may still have some downtime, so if
			you cannot reach it, try again a bit later.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			If you want to contribute to the project, you can send patches in the form of
			unified diffs <em>(diff -u)</em>, against the latest development version.
			If you plan to contribute a lot, and feel qualified to join the development team
			don't hesitate to contact the main developer of the project through
			<a href="mailto:nuclear@siggraph.org">email</a>.
