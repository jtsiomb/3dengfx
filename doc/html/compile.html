		<a name="linux"><h3>GNU/Linux</h3></a>
		<p>
			There is a script installed at /usr/local/bin that will give you automatically
			the compiler and linker options that are needed to compile and link with the
			library.<br>
			Compiler flags: 3dengfx-config --cflags<br>
			Linker options: 3dengfx-config --libs

		<p>
			<ul>
			
				<li>Make sure you have MS Visual Studio .NET 2003 or newer, the old VS.NET
				compiler won't be able to compile the code, and it goes without saying
				that Visual C++ 6.0 won't cut it as well.</li>
				
				<li>Use the included project to build the static library</li>
				
				<li>Link with the static library 3dengfx.lib</li>
				
				<li>Make sure you link with the Multithreaded DLL version of the C runtime</li>
				
				<li>Add the src directory of this library at the include search path</li>
				
				<li>Kill a chicken with a sacrificial blade over the roaring flames of an
				active volcano</li>
				
				<li>Press build...</li>

		<p>
		DevCpp is a free IDE that comes with 
		mingw , a port of gcc for windows. It also comes with a handy package manager
		that allows for easy installation of libraries.
			<ol>
			<li><a href="DevCpp site">Download</a> DevCpp and install.</li>
			<li>Go to <a href="DevPaks site">this page</a> and find the following 
			packages:
				<ul>
				<li>zlib</li>
				<li>libpng</li>
				<li>cg</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Install them with a double click.</li>
			<li>Go <a href="SDL downloads">here</a> and get the latest SDL
			binaries for mingw.Copy the files libSDL.a and libSDLmain.a to the 
			library folder of DevCpp (usually C:\Program Files\Dev-Cpp\lib). Rename
			the "include" folder of the package to "SDL" and copy it to the include
			directory of DevCpp (usually C:\Program Files\Dev-Cpp\include).</li>
			<li>create a new folder for the output files at the directory where
			you extracted this package. Name it "mingw_bin".</li>
			<li>Double click 3dengfx_devcpp.dev</li>
			<li>Go to project/project options/directories/include directories and
			add the directory where you installed 3dengfx. If you installed 3dengfx
			in C:\3dengfx , then add to the path "C:\3dengfx\src"</li>
			<li>Execute/compile. After this you should see in the mingw_bin folder
			among other intermediate files a file named "lib3dengfx.a" ...</li>
			</li>
