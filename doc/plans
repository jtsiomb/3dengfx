3dengfx Future plans
--------------------
This file should be used to record plans for future additions and/or
modifications to the library, so that interesting ideas will not get forgotten.

JT - The 3dengfx initialization should be seperated from SDL at some point and
     become independent of the underlying toolkit. So that it can be integrated
	 with various widget toolkits if need be, or use directly the native
	 graphics interface on each platform (note: cross-platform compatibility
	 MUST be maintained at all costs though, so for native support, there must
	 be multiple implementations integrated with some sort of conditional
	 compilation)

JT - The new particle system is under development. There should be some kind of
     file format for defining particle systems which can be subsequently loaded
	 by the engine, so that particle systems parameters etc. can be tweaked
	 without recompilation. Later on some sort of interactive GUI particle
	 editor should also be made that will produce such particle system files as
	 output.

JT - Development of a better, nicely designed and modular 3d file format(s). Such
     an effort is already underway, and a preliminary design is available. After
	 the solidification of the file format(s), tools will have to be created for
	 converting to, and from, that file format(s).

JT - Some support for controlling the spline interpolation speed is
     available. This support must be refined and enhanced, and again some sort
	 of tool is necessary to define motion curves interactively.
