General Information
-------------------
3dengfx is a 3D visualization system (also commonly referred to as
"3D engine") that provides a wide range of facilities, as high-level
as loading and rendering complete 3D environments with 2 function calls
and as low-level as letting you manipulate every detail, and circuimvent
every automatic process calling equivalent to low-level API functions in
a platform-independent way.

3dengfx is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.
That means that you can use (AND LINK WITH) this library ONLY for free
software programs. no LGPL cheating here... be usefull to the society or
get lost.

Using 3dengfx with your program
-------------------------------
GNU/Linux:
	link with the output of `3dengfx-config --libs` and add the
	output of `3dengfx-config --cflags` to your compiler flags

MS Windows:
	- Make sure you have MS Visual Studio .NET 2003 or newer, the old
	VS.NET compiler won't be able to compile the code, and don't even
	think about VS6 no fucking chance the compiler just sucks too much.
	- Use the included project to build the static library
	- link with the static library 3dengfx.lib
	- make sure you link with the Multithreaded DLL version of the C runtime
	- at the predefined macros define HAVE_CONFIG_H
	- add ALL the libraries subdirectories at the include search path
	- kill a chicken with a sacrificial blade over the roaring flames
	of an active volcano
	- press build...
